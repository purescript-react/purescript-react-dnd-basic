# Basic Example

## Building

You can build this example from the root of the `purescript-react-dnd-basic` project:

```sh
npm install
npm run example:basic
```

This will compile the PureScript source files, bundle them, and combine PureScript and NPM sources into a single bundle.

Then open `html/index.html` in your browser.
